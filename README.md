# AC-DC-SBM
Assortative-Constrained Stochastic Block Models

## Run

To run the AC-DC-SBM algorithm in Julia, execute the following command:

`> julia AC_DCSBM.jl 'dataset_name' seed nb_runs`

### Example

`> julia AC_DCSBM.jl 'A-4-05-02-101' 1234 100`

## Data format

**Graph file.** The graph is represented by a 3-column file, separated by a single space. Each line correpond to one connection in the graph, in which the first value is the number of the first sample, the second value is the number of the second sample, and the third value is the weigth of the edge:

| x_i | x_j | w |

**Important**: Graph files must have the `.link` extension. Some graphs are provided in `/data` folder in this repository.

**Labels file.** The labels files contain the ground-truth community of each sample of the dataset. Each line presents the label of the i-th sample:

y_1

y_2

...

y_n

**Important**: Labels files must have the `.label` extension. Some labels are provided in `/data` folder in this repository.
